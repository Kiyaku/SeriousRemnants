# SeriousRemnants
Use this repository to submit bug reports, suggestions and structures for the SeriousRemnants modpack.


# Recurrent Complex Structure Submissions
If you have an idea or a structure to be used in this pack, open a new ticket starting with [Structure] and post your ideas and/or structure file. 

[TODOL: Add adventureblock instructions]

Please keep some things in mind when building structures:
- The rarity of blocks. If a player can mine out blocks, maybe don't place things that would give you too many resources
- If possible, use as little modded blocks as possible
- You don't have to setup the spawn conditions if you don't want to, but mention in the ticket what your plans for this are (where it should spawn, how often, etc)
